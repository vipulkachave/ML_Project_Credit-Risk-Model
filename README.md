# ML_Project_Credit-Risk-Model

### Project Overview 
A machine learning-based Credit Risk Prediction Model that identifies high-risk borrowers, improves loan approval accuracy, and minimizes default risks for NBFC.

### Project Description
Developed a Credit Risk Prediction Model to classify borrowers into low-risk and high-risk categories, enabling Lauki Finance to make informed loan approval decisions. The project involved comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementing machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The best-performing model was deployed as an interactive Streamlit app to simplify risk assessment.

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers, and conducting EDA to uncover meaningful insights. I strengthened my expertise in evaluating machine learning models using metrics like AUC-ROC, precision, and recall. Additionally, I learned the importance of aligning technical solutions with business objectives, especially in the financial domain.
